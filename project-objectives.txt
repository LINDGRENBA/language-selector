The project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.
Required functionality is in place by the Friday deadline.

Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indendation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.

If you finish the objectives with time to spare, consider adding additional features such as:

Ask the user for their name and address them directly in all of the responses to them: 
Make questions multiple choice (like a, b, or c) and determine which track is right for a user by identifying the letter that was most frequently selected. For example: "You chose mostly a's, you should definitely study C#!".
Other enhancements such as more custom CSS, animation, or modals as you desire.
